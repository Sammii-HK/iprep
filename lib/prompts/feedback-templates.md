# Feedback Templates for Common Issues

## Filler Words Feedback

### High Filler Rate (>5%)
"You used filler words like 'um' and 'like' frequently ([X] instances, [Y]% of words). This undermines your confidence and makes you sound uncertain. Practice: (1) Record yourself and count fillers, (2) Replace fillers with 1-2 second pauses, (3) Practice your answer structure beforehand. Aim for less than 2 fillers per 100 words."

### Moderate Filler Rate (2-5%)
"You have some filler words ([X] instances). Practice replacing 'um' and 'like' with brief pauses. This will make you sound more confident and professional."

### Low Filler Rate (<2%)
"Good job minimizing filler words! Your speech is clear and confident."

## STAR Structure Feedback

### Missing Situation
"Your answer jumps into the action without context. Start with: 'In my previous role at [Company], we faced [specific problem] that was impacting [business metric].' This sets the stage for your story."

### Missing Task
"Clarify what needed to be accomplished. State: 'I was tasked with [specific objective] within [constraints like timeline, budget, team size].' This shows your responsibility and scope."

### Missing Action
"Your answer doesn't detail what YOU specifically did. Use 'I' statements: 'I implemented [solution] by [specific method], I analyzed [data], I collaborated with [team] to [action].' Avoid 'we' - focus on your contributions."

### Missing Result
"End with measurable outcomes: 'This resulted in [specific metric], which [business impact]. For example: reduced latency by 60%, increased conversion by 15%, saved $50K annually, improved team velocity by 30%.'"

### Weak Transitions
"Your STAR components are present but transitions are unclear. Use phrases like: 'The situation was...', 'My task was to...', 'To accomplish this, I...', 'The results were...'"

## Metrics & Impact Feedback

### No Metrics
"Your answer lacks quantifiable impact. Include specific numbers: percentages (60% improvement), time (reduced from 2s to 0.5s), money (saved $50K), scale (handled 1M requests/day), or user impact (improved NPS from 40 to 65)."

### Vague Metrics
"Be more specific. Instead of 'improved performance', say 'reduced page load time from 3.5s to 0.8s' or 'increased API throughput from 1K to 5K requests/second'."

### Missing Business Impact
"You have technical metrics but not business impact. Connect to business outcomes: 'This reduced server costs by 30%' or 'increased user conversion by 22%' or 'improved customer satisfaction scores by 15 points'."

## Technical Accuracy Feedback

### Incorrect Concepts
"Your explanation of [concept] is incorrect. [Correct explanation]. Review core concepts for [domain] before your next interview. Consider: [specific resources or topics to study]."

### Surface-Level Understanding
"Your answer demonstrates basic understanding but lacks depth. Dive deeper: explain why you chose [technology], what trade-offs you considered, alternative approaches you evaluated, and how you validated the solution."

### Missing Technical Details
"Add more technical specifics. Instead of 'I optimized the database', say 'I optimized database queries by adding composite indexes on [columns], which reduced query time from 500ms to 50ms for [specific use case]'."

## Terminology Feedback

### Generic Terms
"Use domain-specific language. Instead of 'made it faster', say 'reduced latency by implementing Redis caching with a TTL of 5 minutes' or 'optimized database queries using composite indexes on user_id and created_at'."

### Incorrect Terminology
"You used '[term]' incorrectly. The correct term is '[correct term]', which means [definition]. Using precise terminology shows expertise."

### Missing Technical Terms
"Incorporate more domain-specific terminology. For [domain], use terms like: [list of relevant terms]. This demonstrates deeper knowledge."

## Pacing & Delivery Feedback

### Too Fast
"You're speaking too quickly ([X] WPM). Slow down and pause between key points. Aim for 120-150 WPM. Practice: (1) Take a breath between sentences, (2) Pause after stating metrics, (3) Let important points sink in."

### Too Slow
"Your pacing is slow with many pauses ([X] WPM, [Y] long pauses). Practice speaking more fluidly while maintaining clarity. Aim for 120-150 WPM."

### Inconsistent Pacing
"Your pacing varies - fast in some parts, slow in others. Maintain consistent rhythm. Practice your answer structure to build muscle memory."

## Confidence Feedback

### Low Confidence Indicators
"Your frequent pauses ([X] long pauses) and filler words ([Y] instances) suggest uncertainty. Practice your answer structure beforehand and speak with conviction. Remember: you're the expert in your experience."

### Overconfidence
"While confidence is good, avoid sounding dismissive of challenges or trade-offs. Acknowledge complexity and show thoughtful consideration."

## Structure & Clarity Feedback

### Unclear Organization
"Your answer lacks clear structure. Organize with: (1) Brief context, (2) Main points in logical order, (3) Supporting details, (4) Conclusion with impact. Use signposts: 'First, I...', 'Then, I...', 'Finally, I...'"

### Too Long
"Your answer is too long ([X] words, [Y] minutes). Aim for 2-3 minutes (200-300 words). Practice being concise: focus on key points, cut unnecessary details, use the STAR method."

### Too Short
"Your answer is too brief ([X] words). Expand with: (1) More context in Situation, (2) Specific steps in Action, (3) Detailed metrics in Result. Aim for 200-300 words."

### Redundancy
"You repeated the same points multiple times. Be concise: state each point once with supporting details, then move on."
