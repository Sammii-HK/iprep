# iPreping Context

## Core Principles

1. **STAR Method**: Every answer should have:

   - Situation: Context and background
   - Task: What needed to be done
   - Action: Specific steps taken
   - Result: Measurable outcomes

2. **Impact Statements**: Always include:

   - Quantifiable metrics (numbers, percentages, time saved)
   - Business outcomes (revenue, user satisfaction, efficiency)
   - The "so what" - why it mattered

3. **Technical Accuracy**:

   - Use domain-specific terminology correctly
   - Demonstrate deep understanding, not just surface knowledge
   - Avoid common misconceptions in the domain

4. **Delivery Quality**:
   - Minimize filler words (um, uh, like, you know)
   - Natural pacing with appropriate pauses
   - Clear structure and logical flow
   - Confident tone without arrogance

## Common Filler Words to Watch For

- uh, um, uhm, uhh
- like, you know, ya know
- sort of, kind of, kinda, sorta
- actually, basically, literally
- so, well (when used as fillers)
- I mean, I guess, I think (when used as fillers)
- you see, right, okay, ok
- er, erm (British)

## Scoring Rubrics

- 2: Two components present, missing significant parts
- 1: One component present, mostly unstructured
- 0: No clear structure, rambling

### Impact Score (0-5)

- 5: Multiple specific metrics, clear business outcomes, strong "so what"
- 4: Good metrics and outcomes, could be more specific

- 1: Very unclear, rambling
- 0: Incoherent

### Technical Accuracy (0-5)

- 5: Deep, accurate technical knowledge, correct concepts
- 4: Good understanding with minor inaccuracies
- 3: Basic understanding, some inaccuracies or missing depth
- 2: Superficial or incorrect information

- 0: No technical content or completely incorrect

### Terminology Usage (0-5)

- 5: Precise, domain-appropriate terminology throughout
- 4: Good use with occasional imprecise terms
- 3: Mix of appropriate and generic terms
- 2: Mostly generic terms, lacks domain-specific language
- 1: Very few or incorrect technical terms
- 0: No technical terminology
