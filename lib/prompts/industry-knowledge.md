## Technical Interview Best Practices

### System Design Questions

- **Key Concepts**: Scalability, reliability, availability, consistency, performance
- **Common Mistakes**:
  - Jumping to solutions without understanding requirements
  - Not considering trade-offs
  - Ignoring non-functional requirements (security, monitoring, etc.)
  - Over-engineering simple problems
- **Good Answer Structure**: Requirements → Constraints → High-level design → Deep dive → Trade-offs → Scale

### Algorithm Questions

- **Key Concepts**: Time/space complexity, data structures, optimization techniques
- **Common Mistakes**:
  - Not clarifying edge cases
  - Not explaining thought process
  - Jumping to code without planning
  - Not considering multiple approaches
- **Good Answer Structure**: Understand problem → Clarify edge cases → Discuss approach → Analyze complexity → Code → Test

### Leadership Questions

- **Key Concepts**: Influence, decision-making, conflict resolution, team development
- **Common Mistakes**:
  - Focusing only on technical achievements
  - Not showing impact on people
  - Vague examples without metrics
  - Not demonstrating growth mindset
- **Good Answer Structure**: Context → Challenge → Leadership approach → Team impact → Business results → Lessons learned

### Behavioral Questions (STAR Method)

- **Situation**: Set context (company, team size, timeframe, constraints)
- **Task**: What needed to be accomplished (your responsibility)
- **Action**: Specific steps YOU took (not "we", use "I")
- **Result**: Measurable outcomes (metrics, business impact, learnings)

## Domain-Specific Terminology

### Software Engineering

- Architecture: microservices, monoliths, event-driven, CQRS, service mesh
- Scalability: horizontal vs vertical, load balancing, sharding, caching strategies
- Performance: latency, throughput, p95/p99, tail latency, backpressure
- Reliability: fault tolerance, circuit breakers, retries, idempotency, eventual consistency
- Security: authentication, authorization, encryption, OAuth, JWT, RBAC

### System Design

- Components: API gateway, load balancer, CDN, database, cache, message queue
- Patterns: pub/sub, request/response, saga, two-phase commit, leader election
- Trade-offs: consistency vs availability, read vs write optimization, cost vs performance

### Leadership & Management

- Team dynamics: psychological safety, blameless postmortems, retrospectives
- Decision-making: consensus, consultative, directive, data-driven
- Impact: OKRs, KPIs, velocity, cycle time, DORA metrics

## Common Interview Pitfalls

1. **Rambling**: Answering without structure, going off-topic

   - Fix: Use STAR method, practice concise answers (2-3 minutes)

2. **No Metrics**: Vague statements like "improved performance"

   - Fix: Always include numbers: "reduced latency by 60%", "increased throughput by 3x"

3. **Technical Inaccuracies**: Using wrong terminology or concepts

   - Fix: Review domain fundamentals, practice explaining concepts out loud

4. **Weak STAR Structure**: Missing components or unclear transitions

   - Fix: Practice identifying Situation/Task/Action/Result in your stories

5. **Excessive Filler Words**: "um", "like", "you know" > 5% of words

   - Fix: Practice pausing silently, record yourself, aim for < 2 fillers per 100 words

6. **No Trade-offs**: Presenting solutions as perfect

   - Fix: Always discuss pros/cons, alternatives considered, why you chose this approach

7. **No Learning/Reflection**: Not showing growth from experience
   - Fix: End with "What I learned" or "What I'd do differently"

## Scoring Benchmarks

### Mid Level (2-5 years)

- STAR Score: 3-4/5 (good structure)
- Impact: 3-4/5 (some metrics)
- Technical: 3-4/5 (solid knowledge)
- Expected: Independent work, some leadership examples

### Senior Level (5-10 years)

- STAR Score: 4-5/5 (excellent structure)
- Impact: 4-5/5 (strong metrics)
- Technical: 4-5/5 (deep expertise)
- Expected: Technical leadership, architectural decisions, mentoring

### Executive Level (10+ years)

- STAR Score: 5/5 (perfect structure)
- Impact: 5/5 (strategic metrics)
- Technical: 4-5/5 (strategic technical vision)
- Expected: Organizational impact, strategic thinking, cross-functional leadership
